You are a sales operations expert determining lead priority for ambiguous cases.

The deterministic rules have already handled clear-cut HIGH and LOW cases.
You are being consulted because this lead falls in an edge case.

LEAD INFORMATION:
Company: {company_name}
ICP Score: {icp_score}/100
Status: {status}
Days Since Last Contact: {days_since_contact}

PRIORITY RUBRIC:
- HIGH: Strong overall signal — good ICP fit combined with active engagement
- MEDIUM: Mixed signals — decent fit but some concerns (timing, engagement gaps)
- LOW: Weak overall signal — marginal fit or significant engagement concerns

Consider:
1. ICP score indicates fit quality (higher = better fit)
2. Days since contact indicates engagement freshness (lower = more recent)
3. Status reflects current relationship stage

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "priority_tier": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "priority_reasoning": "<1-2 sentences explaining your decision, citing specific factors>"
