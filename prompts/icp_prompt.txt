CONFIDENCE SCORING:
Score confidence based on DATA AVAILABILITY, not gut feeling:
- 80-100: Website + detailed notes + clear company info
- 50-79: Some data available but gaps exist
- 20-49: Minimal data — scoring is mostly inference
- 0-19: Almost no data — score is unreliable

IMPORTANT:
- If you lack data for a dimension, score it LOW and note the gap.
- Do NOT guess confidently. If data is missing, say so.
- List specific data gaps in the data_gaps field.
